Schemetic Items to Verify:
1) Is the Load mosfet wired up correctly on the INA circuit?
2) Is the Load mosfet wired up correctly on the ADS circuit?
3) add PWR line through the B2B connector


Layout items to verify:
a) power everywhere
b) gnd everywhere
c) I2C goes through everything
d) power terminal jack polariy is correct
e) jst terminal jack polarity is correct
f) there is enough room for adding silk screen labeling
g) trace widths are correct
f) C4 widths are correct


Comments for the initial layout:
1) board edge should have rounded corner. Co-centric with mounting holes
2) B2B connector should be properly sized
	a) space consumption for DUT
	b) location of headers
	c) add SMT nuts for mounting DUT
3) add proto area
4)
